In the example above, the program gets an image in size 1601 x 664 and performing removal of vertical seams and insertion of horizontal seams 
(The algorithm of seam inseartion is based on seam removal - performing removal of seams and then add these seams to the orginal image).
After the calculations, we get a new image in size 1200 X 900 without losing and destroying important objects in the image.

## Requirements
